# Introduction

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset). 

# Solution

I obtained the following estimation for the out of sample error using (K=4)-fold cross validation: accuracy=0.8917, out_of_sample_error=0.1083.

I used a custom selection of variables from the dataset. I decided to do this after several attemps using PCA were I got worse results. I selected the variables based on the website of the authors of the Weight Lifting Dataset.

The solution is shown in the following R code chunk.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("~/Desktop/Courses_Online/Data_Science_Specialization/08_PracticalMachineLearning/08_august/course_project_github")
rm( list = ls() )

# Read the data from file
training <- read.csv("pml-training.csv", na.strings = c("NA",""))
testing  <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv" , na.strings = c("NA",""))

# Cleaning the data
columns_with_NA <- colSums(is.na(testing))
training <- training[, !columns_with_NA ]
testing  <- testing[ , !columns_with_NA ]
rm("columns_with_NA")
   
# Select variables:
#   roll_belt,     gyros_belt_x  , accel_belt_x
#   roll_arm,      pitch_arm     , yaw_arm
#   roll_forearm,  pitch_forearm , yaw_forearm
#   roll_dumbbell, pitch_dumbbell, yaw_dumbbell
my_vars <- c(8,12,21,22,23,47,48,49, 34, 35, 36)
train_subset <- training[,c(60, my_vars)]
test_subset  <- testing[ ,c(    my_vars)]
rm(my_vars)

# Cross Validation
library(caret)
set.seed(1)
K = 4           # it takes too long in my computer...
cv_subsets <- createFolds( y=train_subset$classe, k = K, list=TRUE, returnTrain=TRUE)
for (k in 1:K) {
  cvk_train <- train_subset[ cv_subsets[[k]],]
  cvk_test  <- train_subset[-cv_subsets[[k]],]
  
  # I use the "gbm" method to train the classifiers
  cvk_model  <- train( classe ~ ., method="gbm", data=cvk_train, verbose=FALSE)
  cvk_classe <- predict(cvk_model, cvk_test)
  cvk_acc    <- sum(cvk_classe == cvk_test$classe)/length(cvk_classe)
  
  if (k==1) {
    cv_models   <- list(cvk_model)
    cv_accuracy <- list(cvk_acc)
  } else {
    cv_models   <- c(cv_models,   list(cvk_model))
    cv_accuracy <- c(cv_accuracy, list(cvk_acc)  )
  }
} 

# out of sample accuracy
plot(y=cv_accuracy,x=1:K)
mean(cv_accuracy)

# Submission information
predicted_classe <- list( predict(cv_models[[k]], test_subset) )

# CP submission
answers = as.character( predicted_classe )
pml_write_files = function(x){
  n = length(x)
  for(i in 1:n){
    filename = paste0("problem_id_",i,".txt")
    write.table(x[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)
  }
}
pml_write_files(answers)
